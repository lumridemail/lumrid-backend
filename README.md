## A Free Unlimited Email Verifier App

Whats inside
- Catchall Detection
- MX Record Detection
- Broken SMTP Handshake


### DO NOT RUN ON YOUR HOME (LOCAL) NETWORK
You risk getting you IP address blacklisted.

## How to Run
I recommend Hosting this flask app through a AWS or GCP instance, but you must apply to get port 25 unblocked to use these platforms.
Otheriwse utilize a proxy provider to mask your IP.

## If you don't want to host the app yourself
We host it for you for Free [lumrid.com](https://www.lumrid.com)
